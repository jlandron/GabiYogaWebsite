TODO: 

- Update Website name to Gabi Yoga, remove references to "Jyoti" - DONE

- Update Hero image to photo-1615729947596-a598e5de0ab3.jpeg - DONE

- Create an admin page where I can post Blog posts which may include images saving data to database.
 * Consider reusing image upload logic from the Admin Photo Gallery with the compression and storeage solutions that already exist, perhaps creating a seperate module with that logic, though we don't want Blog images shown in the Photo Gallery.

- Create a public page that loads my blog posts from newest to oldest.

- Cleanup code in preparation for actual deployment. Validate no logins are visible outside of dev environment, etc.

- Prepare to take payments using Stripe service for both one time payments and subscriptions.

 * deploy 2 test users to Stripe to validate subscriptions and one time payments.

- Create CDK with all needed infrastructure to deploy website to AWS, provide instructions on any manual setup I need to compelete in my AWS account to prepare for deployment. 
 * We will start with no images in the photo Gallery, so no need to upload anything other then the Hero image to AWS.
